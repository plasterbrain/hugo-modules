	---
	We need to call paginate to set titles/canonical URLs, but calling pagination once
	(i.e., in the head meta, before even getting to your main content template handling
	the actual pagination) sets it in stone for the rest of the page load.

	Use this to define how pages should be paginated.

	DO NOT CACHE CALLS TO THIS PARTIAL.

![Hugo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugo-ff4088?style=flat&logo=hugo&logoColor=ffffff)

Modules are like Hugo's version of plug-ins. They can be used to add theme-agnostic functionality like SEO markup to your Hugo site.

## Install
[See HugoMods instructions on how to set up your site to use hugo mods](https://hugomods.com/blog/2023/03/how-to-use-hugo-modules/).

Notes:
- These modules are provided as a starting point rather than a turnkey solution. Most shortcodes use Tailwind classes. If your site is not using Tailwind, the HTML will not be styled correctly out of the box.
- Only US english (`en`) i18n are provided.

Override template files as needed to get the most out of them on your own site.

## @TODO
- Namespacing

## License
These modules are provided in the hopes they will be useful as-is; I can't promise any real support or regular maintenance.

MIT be nice to me no fascists (edit november 2024: I SAID NO FASCISTS!!!! YOU GUYS SERIOUSLY????)

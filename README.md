# plasterbrain's Cool Hugo Modules v0.1.0
![Hugo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugo-ff4088?style=flat&logo=hugo&logoColor=ffffff)

Modules are like Hugo's version of plug-ins. They can be used to add theme-agnostic functionality like SEO markup to your Hugo site.

- SEO/Open Graph
- Social share buttons
- Responsive images & icons
- RSS feed
- Colors
- Third-party embeds

These mods are for my own site(s) and not guaranteed to be a turnkey solution. I will probably only maintain or update them as needed for personal use. Only US English (`en`) i18n is provided.

## Install
[See HugoMods instructions on how to set up your site to use hugo mods](https://hugomods.com/blog/2023/03/how-to-use-hugo-modules/)

Most of the shortcodes use Tailwind classes, so if your site is not using Tailwind, the HTML will not be styled correctly out of the box. Override template files as needed to get the most out of these on your own site.

## License
These modules are provided in the hopes they will be useful as-is; I can't promise any real support or regular maintenance.

MIT be nice to me no fascists (edit november 2024: I SAID NO FASCISTS!!!!)

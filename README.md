# Cool Hugo Modules
Modules are like Hugo's version of plug-ins. They can be used to add theme-agnostic functionality like SEO markup to your Hugo site.

Misc:
- no-js class thing

## Getting started
Some of the modules are pretty barebones or proofs of concept. Look through them and only install the ones you need.

They are also *not* namespaced (avoiding filenames like ✨ *__plaster_coolModules_xoxo_seo-partial.html* ✨ is an act of self-care). Check the contents of each module *before installing* in case their filenames conflict with anything in your theme(s) or site layouts.

Localization strings are available in US english (`"en"`). If your site's content language is not set to `"en"`, the strings will not show up.

1. Install Golang
1. Initialize the module system in your Hugo site directory. @TODO idk if you actually have to do this lol

## License
These modules are provided in the hopes they will be useful as-is; I can't promise any real support or regular maintenance.

MIT be nice to me no fascists

![Hugo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugo-ff4088?style=flat&logo=hugo&logoColor=ffffff)

Modules are like Hugo's version of plug-ins. They can be used to add theme-agnostic functionality like SEO markup to your Hugo site.

- Colors (for WCAG contrast)
- Third-party embeds
- Responsive images & SVG icons
- RSS feed
- Social sharing links/buttons
- SEO/Open Graph

> These mods are for my own site(s) and not guaranteed to be a turnkey solution. I am only updating them as needed for personal use, but feel free to use my spaghetti mess as a starting point. Only US English (`en`) i18n is provided.

## Installation
[See HugoMods instructions on how to set up your site to use Hugo mods](https://hugomods.com/blog/2023/03/how-to-use-hugo-modules/)

Most of the shortcodes use Tailwind classes, so if your site is not using Tailwind, the HTML will not be styled correctly out of the box. Override template files as needed to get the most out of these on your own site.

Individual modules may have their own additional instructions.

## License
These modules are provided in the hopes they will be useful as-is; I can't promise any support or regular maintenance.

MIT, be nice to me, no fascists (edit november 2024: I SAID NO FASCISTS!!!!)
